\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Declutter
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
A function to remove multiple button presses, i.e. data that has multiple values for the same threshold.
}
\usage{
Declutter(tmp, delta)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{tmp}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{tmp} here~~
a 'dark' object with at least two elements; tmp$time and tmp$thrs. 
}
  \item{delta}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{delta} here~~
The minimum time in seconds between responses. Thresholds set within two seconds of each other are discarded apart from the first threshold. }
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
In early data collected with analogue equipment it was psossible for a subject to return multiple button presses when setting just one threshold. This data is characterised by clusters of points within a very short time. This function removes the exptra presses. It is rarely need for data collected from digital equipment. 
}
\value{
Returns an object with the same elements as 'tmp' but with object$time and object$thrs altered. 
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use

%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
