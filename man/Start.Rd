The array of starting parameters is built from the time and threshold data in the object, \code{obj}. 

Each parameter is assumed to have a possible range given the data.  

Each range is constructed as follows; the time  points; \emph{alpha} (cone-rod transition \eqn{\alpha} minutes)  and \emph{beta} (rod-rod transition \eqn{\beta} minutes) are assumed to fall in the first and second halves of the time data respectively (\code{obj$time}). 

The \emph{cone threshold} is assumed to be in the upper half of the threshold data (\code{obj$thrs} log units). The \emph{cone coefficient} (log units) or threshold at time zero is presumed to be positive and the same values are used for the \emph{time constants} (\eqn{tau} minutes).

The rate of rod recovery \emph{S2}, and the combined parameter \emph{-(S2 + S3)} are ranged between -0.6 and 0 log units/minute.

These ranges of possible values are complied into an array by sampling without replacement from each range for each parameter.

\value{Output is an array of seven columns and number of rows = 'Reps'.
