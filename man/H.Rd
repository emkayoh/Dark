\title{
This is a simple switch function.
}
\description{
This function is used to transition from 'off' to 'on'. 
}
\usage{
H(x, k = 100, t)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
is the measured time.
}
  \item{k}{
is the transition constant, set arbitrarily high.
}
  \item{t}{
is the time at which the transition occurs.
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
This helper function used in \code{P5c} and \code{P7c}enables the \code{optim} function to find parameters three times as quickly than if the transitions betwen the phases are modelled by a logical function e.g. a step function.  
}
\value{
For times before 't' the output is less than or equal to 0.5, after this time the the output is greater than 0.5. As 'k' grows larger the rate of transition from 0 to 1 increases.
