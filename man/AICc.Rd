Akaike information criterion 
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
The Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample size is a measure of the relative quality of a model.  The AICc is calculated from a 'dark' object. %%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
AICc(obj)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{ \item{obj}{A dark object
%%     ~~Describe \code{obj} here~~
This object must have at least the following elements:
\tabular{ll}{
obj$time \tab to calculate the number of observations\cr
obj$Pn \tab the number of parameters in the model\cr
obj$val \tab the sum of squared residual error\cr
}
}
}

\value{
The value returned is an indication of the information lost by fitting a particular model to the data, and is only of merit when compared to the value from another model.
