ModelSelect
}
\description{
Returns a list with two elements; an array of AICc scores indexed by the number of parameters in the model considered and a matrix of parameters with three rows, one for each model.

\arguments{
  \item{obj}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{obj} here~~
A 'dark' object. 
}
  \item{P}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{P} here~~
Is a matrix with seven columns and at least one row. The values of each element can be zero.

This is a \emph{brute-force} method to make a first estimate of the optimal model parameters. 

The matrix 'P' holds rows of possible parameter values.
Each row is passed to the 3, 5, and 7 parameter models and the sum of residuals squared is calculated for the given times (obj$time) and thresholds (obj$thrs).
So for each row in 'P' there is a score for each model. Then for each model the row which yields the lowest SSE is chosen as a starting point for optimisation. The optimised parameters are stored in 'param' and once the three parameter arrays have been found their AICc scores are found and returned as AIC.

\value{
Returns a list 
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
\item{AIC }{An array of seven values with AIC scores at the index of model parameter count.
}
\item{param}{A three row by seven column matrix. Each row containing the optimised parameters for each model. }
