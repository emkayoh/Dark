\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
GetData  
 }
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
A template function that gets the data from a file and converts it to a \emph{dark} object for use by other scripts. The script can be modified to format the data. A \emph{dark} object has time data in minutes and thresholds in log units. If the data have been collected in other units then the script should convert them. 

The script defaults to returning data generated by \code{TestData}. }
\usage{
GetData(path, .....)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{path}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{path} here~~
This is the location of the data and will usually be a file path string.  }
  \item{.....}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{.....} here~~
This can be any other values that might be needed to identify the data, e.g. subject number or study reference. 
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
This script can be altered in any way desired and then saved with a different name. I suggest  the format `GetData....R`, where the ellipsis describes the data in some way. 
}
\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
A \emph{dark} object with at least two elements
 \item{time }{the time elapsed after measurements begin in minutes}
 \item{thrs }{the thresholds recorded in log units }
%% ...

other possible values include 
 \item{data }{the name of the data source}
 \item{init }{initial estimates of the optimal model parameters}
 \item{opt }{optimal estimates of the optimal model parameters}
 \item{resid }{the residuals of the data for an optimal model}
